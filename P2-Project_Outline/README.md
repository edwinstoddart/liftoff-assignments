# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to make an MVC application that will allow users to create their own Choose Your Own Adventure stories. It will allow anyone to play an already made story,
and will allow registered users to track which ones they've played and their progress therein. It will also allow registered users to create their own stories for
others to play through. Only the creator of a story will be able to edit or delete their own story.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page that lists the stories they've written (and
	possibly the ones they've read or are reading)
Search: Users will be able to search for stories or authors containing a given string.
Create CYOA: Users will be able to create new Choose Your Own Adventure stories when logged in. New stories will appear in the user's profile when completed.


### Technologies
C#
MySQL
MVC
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll have to learn how to deal with Many-To-Many and One-To-Many relationships between databases on a more in-depth level than what the previous class required.
I'll have to learn more about User Validations and Identity.
I'll have to learn how to dynamically link newly generated pages from a database in an MVC application.
